GIT

GIT is created by Linus Torvald(who created Linux kernel which is open source)
GIT is a distributed version control system

Trunk Based Development : we can create branches in the GIT repository and  push and commit the code as  per the versions

GitHub, gitLab, Atlassian BitBucket are the platforms for the developers 

— Create Repository and create a file 
By default it will be created in master 
— you can create branches for adding/updating the file, thus maintaining versions
— If you want to merge the changes, try to merge by pull request with the new  branch created with the updates and the master branch.

— git Fork
If you want to contribute to any open source project , you can fork that repository means, make a copy of the repository .
Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

To copy local project into git remote repository:

git init
cp ../FXRATE/.gitignore .
git status
git add --all
git status
git commit -am "initial changes "
git remote add origin git@github.com:harinikokinti/MyFirstSpringBootProject.git
git status
git push origin master


—To remove the already added remote by alias(origin)
git remote rm origin

What is JPA?  
———————
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database.
JPA is now considered the standard industry approach for Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) in the Java Industry.
JPA is specification, and requires an implementation.
JPA also defines a runtime EntityManager API for processing queries and transaction on the objects against the database. 


ORM (Object Relational Mapping) 
Java Objects with data are mapped to the database 
Class name - Table name
Class variables - table columns

NOTE:
Hibernate , iBatis, TopLink are the tools to implement the ORM applications where the data is mapped between Java objects and the databases.
With the help of JPA, it is easy to switch between these tools if needed based on the requirements.
Because JPA is a specification where the app is built and the implementation can be any of the tools Hibernate or iBatis or TopLink.
