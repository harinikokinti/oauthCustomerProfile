SPRING - XML
-------------

Spring configuration is done in 3 ways.
1. Using XML file
2. Using annotation based configuration
3. Using Java Configuration(new type)



-- applicationContext.xml
Name doesnt matter
Spring context sort of a HashMap
Can simply be a registry
XML configuration begins with this file
Namespaces aid in configuration/validation


-- Bean creation in the xml file
-- setter injection
-- constructor injection
    Guaranteed contract
    constructor defined
    used together with setter
    Index-based

-- AUTOWIRE
Spring automatically wires beans
4 types of autowiring
  1. by type : autowires based on class type. It should have only 1 type. Ex: Car type
        This allows a property to be autowired if exactly one bean of that property type exists within a container.
        So let's say I have a car object that we're injecting in. If there's only one car object of that type of that class,
        then we can inject it in. But if I have two types of cars, so two car objects with different names,
        I'll get a fatal exception because it can't choose which one of those two because it's just looking at the class type.
  2. by name
  3. by constructor
  4. no  :  none for autowiring
